\section{Schur Decomposition}
Schur decomposition relies on the following theorem.


\begin{theorem}
{\bf Schur's Theorem:} For any complex \footnotemark $n \times n$ matrix $A$, there exists a unitary matrix $Q$ such that $A = Q^\ast U Q$, where $U$ is upper triangular.
\end{theorem}

\footnotetext{The requirement that $A$ be complex doesn't mean we're in trouble if $A$ only has real entries. It just means we have to allow complex entries in the Schur decomposition for the theorem to hold in general. If $A$ is real and has all real eigenvalues, then the Schur decomposition of $A$ will also be real.}

The eigenvalues of $A$ are the diagonal entries of $U$. (Why?) But it follows from Abel's Impossibility Theorem (Theorem \ref{Theorem:Abel}) that no finite algorithm can compute the eigenvalues of $A$ exactly. (How does this follow?) Therefore, no finite algorithm can directly compute the Schur factorization of A.
