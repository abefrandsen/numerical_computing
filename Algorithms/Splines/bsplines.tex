Though B\'{e}zier curves are good for a variety of things, they have certain limitations.
\begin{itemize}
\item As the number of control points increases it becomes very expensive to compute the points on the curve.
\item Changes in the placement of a single control point affect the shape of the entire curve.
\item Since a change in any control point affects the entire curve, it is necessary to recompute the entire curve to account for any change in any control point.
\item As the number of points increases, individual points have progressively less affect on the portions of the curve that lie nearest to them.
\end{itemize}

B-Splines are an ideal way to answer these limitations.
A B-Spline is, roughly speaking, a piecewise B\'{e}zier curve.
In order to better explain what a Basis function is.

\section*{B-Spline Basis Functions}

In the previous lab we introduced a way to represent B\'{e}zier curves as a linear combination of Bernstein Polynomials.
Notice the convenient property that the coefficent of each Bernstein polynomial for the B\'{e}zier curve formed from a given control point is simply the control point itself.

This is a useful property.
B-splines are a generalization of B\'{e}zier curves which allow us to use piecewise basis functions.
Using piecewise basis functions allows us to make local changes to the curve we are representing.
This makes it so that we do not have to recompute the entire curve when we change only one contro point.
This also makes control of the curve easier because changes from each contro point are only applied locally.
Another useful effect is that this makes the individual pieces of the B-Spline more responsive to changes in the control points that are used in creating it.
This, again, makes the curve easier to control.
The idea is that each point has a strictly local influence on the curve so that each point has a larger effect on a smaller portion of the curve.

We would like to be able to do this without loosing the useful properties of B\'{e}zier curves.
Simply using basis functions guarantees that each point of the curve will be a linear combination of the control points.
It would be best if we could make it so that this curve has the convex hull property (i.e. that it lies within the area bounded by the outermost control points).
B\'{e}zier curves also allow easy computation of their derivatives, so we would hope that B-Splines would allow this as well.
One of the largest constrants we need is that the curve we are forming be continuous.
It would be even better if it were differentiable, or even second-differentiable.
The construction of the B-Spline Basis functions takes all of these factors into account.

There are a number of ways the B-Spline basis functions can be defined.
A common approach is to use recursion.
Let $U = \lbrace u_0, u_1, ... , u_m \rbrace$ be a nodecreasing sequence of real numbers.
$U$ is called the knot vector.
The $u_i$ are called the knots.
Note that each $u_i$ is not necessarily distinct.
$N_{i,p}(u)$, the $i$'th B-Spline basis function of degree $p$, or order $p+1$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
N_{i,0}(u) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } u_i \leq u < u_{i+1} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
N_{i,p}(u) = \frac{u - u_i}{u_{i+p} - u_i} N_{i,p-1}(u) + \frac{u_{i + p + 1} - u}{u_{i + p + 1} - u_{i + 1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(u)
\end{equation}

You will notice that we defined $U$ to be nodecreasing, which means some $u_i$ may be repeated.
When you acutually code this up, you will have to take an approach which avoids division by zero.
When we get the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$ we define these terms to be zero.

Also note that $N_{i,0}$ is a step function which is zero except on $[u_i, u_{i+1})$. 
The other basis functions are piecewise polynomials of degree $p$ that are nonzero on $[u_{i-p}, u_{i+1+p})$.
This is also nice because computation of a set of basis functions requires only a knot vector $U$ and a degree $p$, so we can predefine basis functions before we know the actual positions of the control points.

The following is an illustration of the recursive formation the B-Spline basis functions for
