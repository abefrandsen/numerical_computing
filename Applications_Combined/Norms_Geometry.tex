\lab{Applications}{Norms and Geometry}{Norms and Geometry}

\objective{Build intuition about the geometries associated with different norms and metric spaces.}

{\bf Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Review $\ell^p$ norms. Talk about how each is equivalent, but yields different notions of geometry.
\item Talk about different matrix norms. Talk about the right way to calculate them as well.
\end{itemize}
\begin{problem}
Write a function plotting unit ball in different norms.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Write a function that transforms some star-shaped object into its equivalent object in other norms. What is the star of david in the infinity norm? (or something like that)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Something about matrix norms.
\end{problem}
