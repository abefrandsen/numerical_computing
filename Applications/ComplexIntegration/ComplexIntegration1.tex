\objective{Understand the basics of integration in the complex plane}

From multivariable calculus, you may recall that an integral may be taken along a path. This is very similar to what we can be done in the complex plane. Consider the function $f(z)$ on the complex plane. We integrate $f$ along some contour $C$, so we may represent $z$ as a parametric function $z(t)$.
