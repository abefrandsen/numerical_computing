\objective{Introduce Voronoid Diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations and discuss their applications}

\section*{Voronoi Diagrams}

%intro by brute force

%use other metrics

%mention fortune's algorithm

%intro scipy.spatial implementation.
%Be sure to mention KDTrees so they can try a few different implementations of the problems.

\section*{Applications of Voronoi Diagrams}

%Tell the John snow cholera story

%problem using voronoi diagrams as a basis for nearest neighbor queries

%Taxi service problem, Lifelight example

%Retail store placement problem

%Estimate ore deposits and rainfall

\section*{Delaunay Triangulation}

%Mention FEM triangulation and have them write some basic code for it.

\section*{Applications of Delaunay Triangulations}

%Use Delaunay Triangulation to tesselate a 3d surface.
%Use tesselation to rerun ore/rainfall problem and compare results.
